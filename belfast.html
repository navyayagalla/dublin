      <h2>About Belfast</h2>
      <p>
        Belfast is the capital of Northern Ireland, and is apart of the United
        Kingdom. It is the city where the Titanic was created, and holds a long
        history of political conflict between the Unionists and Nationalists of
        Ireland. Though there is peace within the city, the separation is
        visible through the gate between the Unionist and Nationalist
        neighborhoods that shuts nightly. It is home to the Titanic Museum,
        Ulster Museum, Crumlin Road Gaol, and SS Nomadic.
      </p>

        In the countryside of Belfast lies Dunluce Castle and the Giant's
        Causeway. The Giant's Causeway is a path of hexagonal basalt columns
        leading into the sea. It lies at the bottom of a beautiful cliffside and
        can be explored after taking a scenic hike down the mountainside, or
        climbing down The Shepherd's Steps. The Giant's Causeway holds a lot of
        folklore behind its creation. It is said to have been the path made by a
        Giant going from Ireland to Scotland to challenge another Giant, but was
        torn up on the way back so that the Giant couldn't follow him home. The
        geological explanation is that a volcanic eruption led to magma columns
        forming and cooling to create the hexagonal shapes that make up the path
        to the sea. Which explanation do you believe?
