      <h2>About The Cliffs of Moher</h2>
      <p>
        Featured in movies such as "The Princess Bride", "Leap Year", and "Harry Potter & the Half-Blood Prince", the Cliffs of Moher are one of the most scenic parts of Ireland. Located in County Clare, right against the Atlantic Ocean, the cliffs provide a visually striking view of the coast. The cliffs are classified as a UNESCO Global Geopark and are one of the world's most important seabird nesting sites. The surrounding farms are home to cows that graze on the grass and wildflowers on top of the cliffs. 
      </p>
      <p>
        On a clear day, the cliffs can be seen for miles at length, and in total, they cover a length of around 8 miles against the sea. The visitor center at the cliffs is a great place to stop to learn more about the cliffs themselves, as well as to grab a bite or view the cliffs exhibition on display. Taking the path up the cliffs will lead you to O'Brien's Tower, a viewpoint along the cliffs where you can enjoy some bird-watching. The Cliffs of Moher experience covers a walled, paved path provided to allow safe exploration of the cliffs, but beyond their trail, the coastal hike continues. The farther out you explore, the more dangerous the trail gets, so exploration is encouraged at your own risk.
