            <h2>1. A Trip to the Countryside & Howth Cliffs</h2>
            <b><time datetime="2024-05-07">May 6, 2024 ~ Monday</time></b>
            <p>
            Hooray for the first day of the trip! We went to <a href="https://www.visitdublin.com/howth-cliff-path-loop">Howth Cliffs</a> straight
            from the Dublin airport to fight our looming jet lag. The cliffs were
            absolutely beautiful, right on the sea and surrounded by blooming
            yellow flowers. The steep stone steps led down to an incredible view.</p>
            <br>
            <p>After exploring Howth and eating some lovely seafood at <a href="https://wrightsofhowth.shop/pages/crabbyjos">Crabby Jo's</a>,
            we went back to Dublin and checked into our lodging for the trip. From
            there we enjoyed a dinner at the oldest pub in Ireland, <a href="https://brazenhead.com/">the Brazen Head</a>!

            <h2>2. Exploring Dublin: A City of History and Culture</h2>
            <b><time datetime="2024-05-07">May 7, 2024 ~ Tuesday</time></b>
            <p>
            On this Tuesday, we had our first day of orientation for the CEA Capa
            program and went on a historic bus tour of Dublin! Our tour guide
            showed us many of the famous battle locations while telling us about
            the bigger parts of Irish history. We learned more about <a href="https://www.ighm.org/learn.html">the Great
            Hunger of Ireland</a> and how that led to Irish emigration across the
            world.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Some of the locations we went to on this tour included <a href="https://heritageireland.ie/places-to-visit/phoenix-park-peoples-flower-gardens/">the
            People's Gardens</a>, <a href="https://www.buildingsofireland.ie/buildings-search/building/50070100/church-of-the-sacred-heart-arbour-hill-dublin-7-dublin">Church of the Sacred Heart</a> which included a dedication
            to the buried rebels, <a href="https://www.visitdublin.com/the-jeanie-johnston">the Jeanie Johnston Famine Ship</a> & <a href="https://www.visitdublin.com/famine-memorial">surrounding
            statues</a>, and <a href="https://christchurchcathedral.ie/">the Christchurch Cathedral</a>.

            <h2>3. First Day of Class!</h2>
            <b><time datetime="2024-05-07">May 8, 2024 ~ Wednesday</time></b>
            <p>
            SI 339 began today! We had our first class and created our website
            detailing our study abroad trip to Dublin, which you're on right now
            (inception...). After playing around with styling, adding some
            pictures, finding Irish fonts, and creating a blog, we wrapped up
            class for the day.</p>
            <br>
            <p>From there, we had the rest of the day to explore
            Dublin so we went to a charity shop and then explored <a href="https://www.graftonstreet.ie/">Grafton Street</a>!
            We grabbed some coffee and enjoyed spending time in nature at <a href="https://www.ststephensgreenpark.ie/">St.
            Stephen's Green</a>. Finally, we went to <a href="https://johnsbar.ie/">John's Bar & Haberdashery</a> to take
            advantage of their student burger meal deal.

            <h2>4. Guest Lecture with Dr David Williams: Games, Engagement, and Accessibility</h2>
            <b><time datetime="2024-05-09">May 9, 2024 ~ Thursday</time></b>
            <p>
            In class today, we learned about flexbox, transitions, media queries, and responsive design. To apply these concepts, we played around with our image grids and adapted our webpages to be accessible and viewable on both mobile and desktop views. After class, we had a lunch break. After eating lunch back at my room, I came back to <a href="https://www.griffith.ie/">Griffith College</a> campus and decided to try a coffee and a pastry from <a href="https://noshington.ie/">Noshington Cafe</a>, the cafe down the street from our college. It was amazing and I will definitely be going back!
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
            After we came back to campus, it was time for our guest lecture from Dr. David Williams and his wife, Anna Leary. I found this lecture to be very interesting and engaging, as it covered the topics of accessibility and gameification within the realm of web design. Dr. Williams talked about the theory behind gameification and Anna Leary showed us some practical examples of web design by detailing how she had to overhaul the <a href="https://library.dbs.ie/">Dublin Business School's Library website</a>. Once class was over, we decided to grab dinner together in the Grafton Street neighborhood. We wanted to go to a really popular and well-reviewed taco restaurant called <a href="https://www.masadublin.com/">Masa</a>, but it was fully booked so we agreed to make reservations and come another time. From there, we went to <a href="https://theramenbar.ie/">The Ramen Bar</a>, which had great food and even better ambiance.
