          <h2>A Trip to the Countryside & Howth Cliffs</h2>
          <b><time datetime="2024-05-07">May 6, 2024 ~ Monday</time></b>
          <p>
            Hooray for the first day of the trip! We went to
            <a href="https://www.visitdublin.com/howth-cliff-path-loop"
              >Howth Cliffs</a
            >
            straight from the Dublin airport to fight our looming jet lag. The
            cliffs were absolutely beautiful, right on the sea and surrounded by
            blooming yellow flowers. The steep stone steps led down to an
            incredible view.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            After exploring Howth and eating some lovely seafood at
            <a href="https://wrightsofhowth.shop/pages/crabbyjos">Crabby Jo's</a
            >, we went back to Dublin and checked into our lodging for the trip.
            From there we enjoyed a dinner at the oldest pub in Ireland,
            <a href="https://brazenhead.com/">the Brazen Head</a>!

          <h2>Exploring Dublin: A City of History and Culture</h2>
          <b><time datetime="2024-05-07">May 7, 2024 ~ Tuesday</time></b>
          <p>
            On this Tuesday, we had our first day of orientation for the CEA
            Capa program and went on a historic bus tour of Dublin! Our tour
            guide showed us many of the famous battle locations while telling us
            about the bigger parts of Irish history. We learned more about
            <a href="https://www.ighm.org/learn.html"
              >the Great Hunger of Ireland</a
            >
            and how that led to Irish emigration across the world.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Some of the locations we went to on this tour included
            <a
              href="https://heritageireland.ie/places-to-visit/phoenix-park-peoples-flower-gardens/"

              >Church of the Sacred Heart</a
            >
            which included a dedication to the buried rebels,
            <a href="https://www.visitdublin.com/the-jeanie-johnston"
              >the Jeanie Johnston Famine Ship</a

          <h2>First Day of Class!</h2>
          <b><time datetime="2024-05-07">May 8, 2024 ~ Wednesday</time></b>
          <p>
            SI 339 began today! We had our first class and created our website
            detailing our study abroad trip to Dublin, which you're on right now
            (inception...). After playing around with styling, adding some
            pictures, finding Irish fonts, and creating a blog, we wrapped up
            class for the day.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            From there, we had the rest of the day to explore Dublin so we went
            to a charity shop and then explored
            <a href="https://www.graftonstreet.ie/">Grafton Street</a>! We
            grabbed some coffee and enjoyed spending time in nature at
            <a href="https://www.ststephensgreenpark.ie/">St. Stephen's Green</a
            >. Finally, we went to
            <a href="https://johnsbar.ie/">John's Bar & Haberdashery</a> to take
            advantage of their student burger meal deal.

            Guest Lecture with Dr David Williams: Games, Engagement, and
            Accessibility
          </h2>
          <b><time datetime="2024-05-09">May 9, 2024 ~ Thursday</time></b>
          <p>
            In class today, we learned about flexbox, transitions, media
            queries, and responsive design. To apply these concepts, we played
            around with our image grids and adapted our webpages to be
            accessible and viewable on both mobile and desktop views. After
            class, we had a lunch break. After eating lunch back at my room, I
            came back to
            <a href="https://www.griffith.ie/">Griffith College</a> campus and
            decided to try a coffee and a pastry from
            <a href="https://noshington.ie/">Noshington Cafe</a>, the cafe down
            the street from our college. It was amazing and I will definitely be
            going back!
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            After we came back to campus, it was time for our guest lecture from
            Dr. David Williams and his wife, Anna Leary. I found this lecture to
            be very interesting and engaging, as it covered the topics of
            accessibility and gameification within the realm of web design. Dr.
            Williams talked about the theory behind gameification and Anna Leary
            showed us some practical examples of web design by detailing how she
            had to overhaul the
            <a href="https://library.dbs.ie/"
              >Dublin Business School's Library website</a
            >. Once class was over, we decided to grab dinner together in the
            Grafton Street neighborhood. We wanted to go to a really popular and
            well-reviewed taco restaurant called
            <a href="https://www.masadublin.com/">Masa</a>, but it was fully
            booked so we agreed to make reservations and come another time. From
            there, we went to
            <a href="https://theramenbar.ie/">The Ramen Bar</a>, which had great
            food and even better ambiance.

          <h2>Visit to the EPIC Emigration Museum</h2>
          <b><time datetime="2024-05-09">May 10, 2024 ~ Friday</time></b>
          <p>
            First Friday in Dublin! In class today we talked about responsive
            web design and accessibility in navigation. We updated our navbars
            to display the current page more distinctly and made sure all of our
            links were active and working. After class, I went to
            <a href="https://www.libertymarket.ie/">the Liberty Market</a> and
            browsed the variety of merchandise they had at the market. It was
            only a few blocks away from our lodging! I bought a Turkish bracelet
            before going home to eat lunch.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            After lunch, I walked to
            <a href="https://epicchq.com/">the EPIC Emigration Museum</a> for
            our class visit. Almost the whole walk was along the water, so it
            was a beautiful view to take in! It was beautifully sunny today so I
            wanted to take advantage of the nice weather. The emigration museum
            was incredibly detailed and informative, and I felt like I learned
            alot about the places that Irish people went to after the famine,
            and the lives they formed once they got there. Lauren and I struck
            up a great conversation with one of the museum docents about local's
            recommendations for Dublin, Maymesters, and what life at
            <a href="https://www.ucd.ie/">University College Dublin</a> is like
            for her.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Once we ended our museum visit, Lauren and I walked around the north
            side of the river, as we hadn't explored that area a lot. We ended
            up trying, (and LOVING) Irish Coffee at
            <a href="https://www.vicecoffeeinc.com/">Vice Coffee</a>, and we
            both also indulged in baked goods to satisfy our sugar cravings.
            Then we went to
            <a href="https://www.winding-stair.com/">The Winding Stair</a>, an
            adorable bookstore along the river where I got some postcards to
            send to my family. There were ebautiful watercolor renditions of
            Dublin sites, and I got one of
            <a
              href="https://www.buildingsofireland.ie/buildings-search/building/50080682/saint-patricks-park-patrick-street-bull-alley-street-dublin-8-dublin"
              >St. Patrick's Park</a
            >, since it is the park that is so close to our lodging. I'm excited
            to celebrate my first Friday night in Dublin and reflect on the
            first wonderful week!
