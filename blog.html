              Hooray for the first day of the trip! We went to
              <a href="https://www.visitdublin.com/howth-cliff-path-loop"
                >Howth Cliffs</a
              >
              straight from the Dublin airport to fight our looming jet lag. The
              cliffs were absolutely beautiful, right on the sea and surrounded
              by blooming yellow flowers. The steep stone steps led down to an
              incredible view.
            </p>
            <p>
              After exploring Howth and eating some lovely seafood at

                >Crabby Jo's</a
              >, we went back to Dublin and checked into our lodging for the
              trip. From there we enjoyed a dinner at the oldest pub in Ireland,

              On this Tuesday, we had our first day of orientation for the CEA
              Capa program and went on a historic bus tour of Dublin! Our tour
              guide showed us many of the famous battle locations while telling
              us about the bigger parts of Irish history. We learned more about
              <a href="https://www.ighm.org/learn.html"
                >the Great Hunger of Ireland</a
              >
              and how that led to Irish emigration across the world.

                >Church of the Sacred Heart</a
              >
              which included a dedication to the buried rebels,

              SI 339 began today! We had our first class and created our website
              detailing our study abroad trip to Dublin, which you're on right
              now (inception...). After playing around with styling, adding some
              pictures, finding Irish fonts, and creating a blog, we wrapped up
              class for the day.
            </p>
            <p>
              From there, we had the rest of the day to explore Dublin so we
              went to a charity shop and then explored
              <a href="https://www.graftonstreet.ie/">Grafton Street</a>! We
              grabbed some coffee and enjoyed spending time in nature at
              <a href="https://www.ststephensgreenpark.ie/"
                >St. Stephen's Green</a
              >. Finally, we went to
              <a href="https://johnsbar.ie/">John's Bar & Haberdashery</a> to
              take advantage of their student burger meal deal.

            Guest Lecture with Dr David Williams: Games, Engagement, and

              In class today, we learned about flexbox, transitions, media
              queries, and responsive design. To apply these concepts, we played
              around with our image grids and adapted our webpages to be
              accessible and viewable on both mobile and desktop views. After
              class, we had a lunch break. After eating lunch back at my room, I
              came back to
              <a href="https://www.griffith.ie/">Griffith College</a> campus and
              decided to try a coffee and a pastry from
              <a href="https://noshington.ie/">Noshington Cafe</a>, the cafe
              down the street from our college. It was amazing and I will
              definitely be going back!
            </p>
            <p>
              After we came back to campus, it was time for our guest lecture
              from Dr. David Williams and his wife, Anna Leary. I found this
              lecture to be very interesting and engaging, as it covered the
              topics of accessibility and gameification within the realm of web
              design. Dr. Williams talked about the theory behind gameification
              and Anna Leary showed us some practical examples of web design by
              detailing how she had to overhaul the
              <a href="https://library.dbs.ie/"
                >Dublin Business School's Library website</a
              >. Once class was over, we decided to grab dinner together in the
              Grafton Street neighborhood. We wanted to go to a really popular
              and well-reviewed taco restaurant called
              <a href="https://www.masadublin.com/">Masa</a>, but it was fully
              booked so we agreed to make reservations and come another time.
              From there, we went to
              <a href="https://theramenbar.ie/">The Ramen Bar</a>, which had
              great food and even better ambiance.

          <h3>Visit to the EPIC Emigration Museum</h3>

            <p>
              First Friday in Dublin! In class today we talked about responsive
              web design and accessibility in navigation. We updated our navbars
              to display the current page more distinctly and made sure all of
              our links were active and working. After class, I went to
              <a href="https://www.libertymarket.ie/">the Liberty Market</a> and
              browsed the variety of merchandise they had at the market. It was
              only a few blocks away from our lodging! I bought a Turkish
              bracelet before going home to eat lunch.
            </p>
            <p>
              After lunch, I walked to
              <a href="https://epicchq.com/">the EPIC Emigration Museum</a> for
              our class visit. Almost the whole walk was along the water, so it
              was a beautiful view to take in! It was beautifully sunny today so
              I wanted to take advantage of the nice weather. The emigration
              museum was incredibly detailed and informative, and I felt like I
              learned alot about the places that Irish people went to after the
              famine, and the lives they formed once they got there. Lauren and
              I struck up a great conversation with one of the museum docents
              about local's recommendations for Dublin, Maymesters, and what
              life at
              <a href="https://www.ucd.ie/">University College Dublin</a> is
              like for her.
            </p>
            <p>
              Once we ended our museum visit, Lauren and I walked around the
              north side of the river, as we hadn't explored that area a lot. We
              ended up trying, (and LOVING) Irish Coffee at
              <a href="https://www.vicecoffeeinc.com/">Vice Coffee</a>, and we
              both also indulged in baked goods to satisfy our sugar cravings.
              Then we went to
              <a href="https://www.winding-stair.com/">The Winding Stair</a>, an
              adorable bookstore along the river where I got some postcards to
              send to my family. There were ebautiful watercolor renditions of
              Dublin sites, and I got one of
              <a
                href="https://www.buildingsofireland.ie/buildings-search/building/50080682/saint-patricks-park-patrick-street-bull-alley-street-dublin-8-dublin"
                >St. Patrick's Park</a
              >, since it is the park that is so close to our lodging. I'm
              excited to celebrate my first Friday night in Dublin and reflect
              on the first wonderful week!

              Today our whole group went on a day trip to
              <a href="https://glendalough.ie/">Glendalough</a> &
              <a href="https://visitkilkenny.ie/">Kilkenny</a>, two beautiful
              areas of Ireland! At Glendalough, we explored the monastic ruins
              that exist there and learned about the history of
              <a href="https://glendalough.ie/heritage/monastic-city/"
                >St. Kevin's community</a
              >. Then, we ventured down the trail surrounding the
              <a href="https://www.nationalparks.ie/wicklow/"
                >Wicklow Mountains</a
              >
              to the lower & upper lakes, the former of which can be seen below.
              They were absolutely breath-taking, and had such picturesque views
              I almost couldn't believe they were real. I took a lot of pictures
              of the views, which exist on my
              <a href="glendalough.html">Glendalough</a> page. It was beautiful
              and sunny and there were even people swimming in the lakes! By the
              upper lake there was a tree that had a limb that was bent
              perfectly in the shape of a hammock, and there was someone
              relaxing and reading a book in it. Overall, Glendalough lived up
              to its Irish name of being the "Glen Between Lakes", and was an
              incredibly green and serene area.
            </p>
            <p>
              From there, we went to Kilkenny to explore
              <a href="https://kilkennycastle.ie/">Kilkenny Castle</a> and the
              surrounding town. More pictures from this trip can be found at my
              <a href="kilkenny.html">Kilkenny</a> page. The castle itself was
              grand from the outside, but the restoration of the inside was the
              most amazing part. There were 20 different rooms and areas to
              explore within the castle, each restored to how it would've been
              when the castle was operational. My favorite room was the
              <a href="https://kilkennycastle.ie/the-picture-gallery/"
                >Picture Gallery Wing</a
              >, a room filled with beautiful paintings that had dark, immersive
              lighting similar to what I've seen of Trinity College's Long Room.
              The green surrounding the castle was filled with people enjoying
              the sun and picnic-ing. A shopkeeper in Kilkenny told us that it
              was a lot busier that day because Bruce Springsteen was having a
              concert in town that night!
            </p>
            <p>
              After the day trip, Lauren and I took the bus for the first time
              and got dinner at <a href="https://www.kari.ie/">Kari</a>, one of
              the most highly rated restaurants in Dublin. The food was
              absolutely incredible! It is an Indian restaurant, so I got the
              lamb biryani, and Lauren got chicken makhani. We both cleaned our
              plates in a matter of minutes, and the chef was so impressed with
              our speed and enjoyment that he brought us free dessert! The
              biryani was dotted with pomegranate seeds and spiced to
              perfection. I will definitely remember this meal as one of my
              favorites in Dublin, it was some of the best food I've had in a
              really long time!

          <h3>A Tour of Belfast & Northern Ireland</h3>
          <button class="accordion">

          <div class="panel">
            <p>
              On our free day, Sophie, Sarah, Lauren, Anastasia, and I decided
              to book a bus tour to
              <a href="https://www.irishtourism.com/belfast"
                >Belfast & Northern Ireland</a
              >
              to explore the northern part of the island! The tour left at 6am,
              and first took us to Belfast for a
              <a href="https://belfasttours.com/">black cab tour</a> of
              Belfast's political history (the dynamic of which is still a huge
              part of the city today). I'd never known about the extent of
              separation between the Unionist and Nationalist areas of Ireland,
              and it was incredibly interesting to learn about how their beliefs
              connect to other areas in world politics as well. Since we were in
              Northern Ireland, we were officially in the United Kingdom, which
              was something I hadn't quite wrapped my head around yet.
            </p>
            <p>
              From the black cab tour, we went to
              <a
                href="https://discovernorthernireland.com/things-to-do/dunluce-castle-p675011"
                >Dunluce Castle</a
              >, and then went to the
              <a
                href="https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/visit/northern-ireland/giants-causeway"
                >Giant's Causeway</a
              >, where we wrapped up the tour. Dunluce Castle was absolutely
              beautiful, as it lays right on the cliffs of Northern Ireland. The
              view was breathtaking, and the weather held out so we got to
              experience the castle to the fullest extent. Anastasia and I were
              able to go up inside of the round tower, which made the view even
              better. The Giant's Causeway was something I was incredibly
              excited to see, as my dad used to read me folk tales about it as a
              kid. Hearing the bus tour guide recap
              <a
                href="https://www.thegiantscausewaytour.com/the-giants-causeway-story/"
                >the folklore</a
              >
              behind it's creation reminded me of my childhood, and it
              definitely exceeded expectations. The causeway itself is
              incredibly beautiful, and the color of the stones contrasted with
              the sea in a stunning manner. The hike down to the Causeway took
              us down the Shepherd's Steps, which were a steep set of stairs
              followed by a short trail down to the Causeway, complete with
              incredible scenery along the way. After our nature exploration, we
              decided to follow our tour guide's recommendation and get lunch at
              <a
                href="https://discovernorthernireland.com/food-and-drink/the-nook-at-the-giants-causeway-p685931"
                >The Nook</a
              >, 1 of 2 small restaurants at the Causeway. Our tour guide said
              that the Irish Stew at the Nook would be his death row meal should
              capital punishment ever return to Ireland, and so naturally, we
              all had to try it. It did not disappoint, and after our long day,
              it felt like one of the most satisfying meals I'd had in a long
              time. I've written more about this trip on my
              <a href="belfast.html">Belfast</a> page.

              Today we finally got to experience some true Irish weather! It was
              rainy and a bit bleary for most of the day, but it got sunnier
              towards the end of the night. In class we reflected on our weekend
              by developing our Glendalough and Kilkenny pages, and reviewed the
              content that we've covered in the course thusfar. After class, I
              ate lunch at
              <a href="https://little-bird.ie/">Little Bird Cafe</a> and worked
              on my website for a while. Then, I headed back to Griffith College
              to meet up with the students to head to the
              <a href="https://nda.ie/"
                >National Disability Authority of Ireland</a
              >.
            </p>
            <p>
              There, Donal Rice gave a talk on how the Civil Rights movement was
              the precursor to the Accessibility movement, and in turn, the Web
              Accessibility movement. It was amazing to see how the history of
              advocacy and disability awareness connect, and to see how dynamic
              of a field it still is today. We compared European Union and
              United States approaches to disability policy, and discussed whose
              approach might be better. After the talk, Lauren and I explored
              <a href="https://jamartfactory.com/">Jam Art Factory</a> near our
              lodging and I purchased a beautiful print of Dublin to put in my
              room in Ann Arbor. Afterwards, Anastasia and I went grocery
              shopping again and made dinner in our room. We made some delicious
              pasta and then headed out to meet Sophie, Sarah, and Lauren for a
              pint at <a href="http://www.lordedward.ie/">the Lord Edward</a>,
              which was supposed to have the best Guinness in town, according to
              our first tour guide. We tried it, and out of the three Guinnesses
              I've had, I can safely say it is the best one yet!

              Today, we took advantage of the good weather, (and our newly
              topped-up Leap Cards), and took the DART train to
              <a href="https://bray.ie/">Bray, Ireland</a>! Bray is a coastal
              town south of Dublin that is known for it's amazing eateries and
              beautiful hiking. Sophie, Sarah, and I decided to do the
              <a href="https://bray.ie/bray-head-loop-trail/"
                >Bray Head Loop Trail</a
              >
              , which is a 10km loop that goes through the mountains of Bray
              Head. Our hike started off on an interesting foot because the
              entry gate was shut, and stated that the Bray Head Cliff Walk was
              closed due to rockfalls. We opened the entry gate and decided to
              proceed with caution through the Bray Head Loop. We were rewarded
              with the incredible views pictured below, along with lots of fun
              animal sightings along the way! We saw cows grazing, a hawk
              sitting on a tree, many starlings, and some fun dogs. The
              starlings were also present at our lunch restaurant,
              <a href="https://www.themartello.ie/the-martello.html"
                >The Martello</a
              >, and pounced on our food the second we got up from the table.
              Our waitress said they are omnipresent, and in her words, "They
              can't do anything about, even though they reign all over a woman,
              because they're endangered!" I can safely say that the hike was
              one of the prettiest hikes I've ever been on! The views from the
              top allowed us to see a 360 degree view of Bray Head and the
              surrounding town. The hills were coated with yellow flowers, and
              the rocky mountains were made from granite formations. Even the
              train ride there was along the water most of the time, so it was a
              day filled with breath-taking scenery.

              In class today, we reflected on our favorite things about Ireland
              so far, and then spent some time beefing up the content of our
              websites. After class, my mom's friend from college, Archana,
              brought me chicken biryani, so I got to have a taste of home for
              lunch! We relaxed for a bit during lunch and then went to the St.
              Stephen's Green station to take the
              <a href="https://www.luas.ie/">LUAS</a> tram to the
              <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-ie/aboutireland"
                >Microsoft Ireland HQ</a
              >. The tram moved incredibly slow, but it was nice to see the
              different parts of Dublin further from when we live. At Microsoft,
              we got a tour of their office, which I've included some pictures
              from below. It was a beautiful (and MASSIVE) office, with lots of
              natural light from the circular ceiling skylights. After we got a
              tour of their various amenities such as a sleeping area, a yoga
              room, and a roof patio lounge, we went into the conference room to
              hear a presentation about AI. Victor and Linda, our tour guides,
              talked about Microsoft's history and the new AI projects they are
              investing in, such as Sora and Copilot. I'd never known how
              connected Microsoft and
              <a href="https://openai.com/">OpenAI</a> are, so it was
              interesting to hear about the various developments in AI and how
              that connects to Microsoft's role as a company. We learned about
              the details of the different models that OpenAI has created, such
              as GPT4, GPT4V, DALL-E, and Sora. Overall, I learned a lot more
              about AI and the developments that the future holds, and am
              excited to see where this technology goes in the next few years!
            </p>
            <p>
              After the Microsoft visit, Lauren, Sam, Anastasia and I took the
              LUAS back home, after buying a new ticket because I'd somehow lost
              my Leap Card during the visit. 3 stops in, the power failed on the
              entire green line, so we had to get off and find another way home.
              We decided to split a taxi, and agreed to celebrate our minor
              inconvenience by enjoying the student meal deal at
              <a href="https://johnsbar.ie/">John's Bar & Haberdashery</a>
              again, which is a burger, fries, and a pint for 13 Euros. It was a
              great way to destress from the day! After that, Lauren and I
              realized that
              <a href="https://www.toogoodtogo.com/">TooGoodToGo</a>, a food
              waste prevention app, works really well in Dublin. Any extra food
              that restaurants or cafes have after the day ends can be put onto
              the app, and people can purchase it for discounted prices. Lauren
              and I decided to split a 6 pack of donuts from the
              <a href="https://offbeatdonuts.com/">Off Beat Donut Company</a>,
              which were absolutely incredible. I walked to the Trinity College
              area to pick up the donuts, and it was bustling with students
              getting ready for a night out. Once I retrieved the donuts, Sam,
              Ben, Lauren, Anastasia, Mari, and I went to
              <a href="https://www.street66.bar/">Street 66</a>, where we played
              a game called
              <a

                >Taco Cat Goat Cheese Pizza</a
              >, and hung out for a few hours.

          <h3>Tour of the Docklands with Dr. Darren Kelly</h3>

            <p>
              We began learning JavaScript in class today, and played around
              with making some elements respond to events such as clicks or
              hovers. After class, I decided to explore some areas of Dublin
              I've been meaning to get to, one of which was
              <a href="https://georgesstreetarcade.ie/"
                >George's Street Arcade</a
              >! It was a quaint little market inside a beautiful old building,
              and was home to many different kinds of knick-knack and art
              stores. I bought a few postcards to send to my friends and family,
              and then moved on to the antique & collectables store next door,
              which was called
              <a href="https://www.spottedbylocals.com/dublin/needful-things/"
                >Needful Things</a
              >. I bought an old postcard there that showed
              <a href="https://www.graftonstreet.ie/">Grafton Street</a> before
              it was pedestrianized, which was a cool thing to see.
            </p>
            <p>
              From there, I grabbed a quick coffee at
              <a href="https://shoelanecoffee.ie/">Shoe Lane Coffee</a>, and
              then headed to the
              <a
                href="https://heritageireland.ie/places-to-visit/custom-house-visitor-centre/"
                >Custom House</a
              >
              to meet Dr. Darren Kelly for our tour of the
              <a href="https://www.dublindocklands.ie/">Docklands</a>. We
              learned all about Ireland's financial history and how quickly the
              development of the financial district has come about. I remember
              he compared the growth of Ireland's financial district to how
              quickly a flower blooms in a nature timelapse. He showed us some
              pictures from the 1990s and early 2000s where the buildings that
              currently exist weren't there at all. We also learned about the
              current housing crisis in Ireland, and how that connects to their
              economic history.
            </p>
            <p>
              After the Docklands tour, Lauren, Sophie, Sarah, Mari, and I went
              to dinner at a place called
              <a href="https://www.cafetopolis.com/">Cafe Topolis</a>, where we
              had some delicious Italian food which is pictured below. It was a
              long, slow dinner and it was nice to have a relaxed conversation
              with everyone after a busy day. On our way home, I saw a familiar
              face biking past me, and I realized it was someone I'd known from
              Michigan. He was originally from Ireland but was studying at
              Michigan for a while, but had moved back to Dublin after
              graduating. I called out after him and we had a little
              conversation about just how random it was that we'd ran into each
              other. I hadn't seen him in a long time so it was nice to catch up
              with him! Dublin is a big city, but he just happened to be biking
              past the street we were on. It felt like one of those beautiful
              small world moments. From there, we explored the nightlife of
              Dublin, and ended up at
              <a href="https://theworkmansclub.com/">The Workman's Club</a> for
              the night.

              Today we played around with learning how to create accordions
              within our webpage. We implemented them using JavaScript, and
              first tested them on our blogs. Then we played around with
              <a href="https://www.kunkalabs.com/mixitup/">MixItUp</a>, an
              open-source way of categorizing photos or other objects into
              groups by clicking on them. Finally, I worked on creating an
              on-click animation for the
              <a href="https://bereal.com/en/">BeReals</a> in my Dublin page so
              that you can interact with them in a similar way to real BeReals.
            </p>
            <p>
              After class, Lauren and I grabbed lunch at
              <a href="https://thefumbally.ie/">The Fumbally</a>, where I got
              their incredible lentils again. It was the perfect warm meal for a
              cloudy day. Then we headed home to drop off our things, and met up
              with the rest of the group at Trinity to walk to the
              <a
                href="https://www.google.com/about/careers/applications/locations/dublin"
                >Google Ireland</a
              >
              campus together. Walking through the grounds of Trinity was
              absolutely beautiful, especially because we got a little sun
              today. It's a magnificent campus, and I hope that during my time
              here I will be able to see the
              <a href="https://www.tcd.ie/library/old-library/long-room/"
                >Long Room</a
              >
              in the library and the
              <a href="https://www.visittrinity.ie/book-of-kells-experience/"
                >Book of Kells</a
              >. We took our time strolling through the campus and still got to
              the Google Ireland building early! We got an insightful tour of
              the Ireland office from Wanja, Ganesh, and Eoin. It was
              interesting to hear their opinions on how Google and other big
              tech companies have changed in the last few years, especially with
              the current job market. The Ireland campus itself was incredibly
              large, and we were able to tour 3 of their buildings.
            </p>
            <p>
              Once the tour was over, a lot of us walked to the Grafton street
              area to peruse the streets. We stopped at
              <a href="https://www.sweny.ie/">Sweny's Pharmacy</a>, a place my
              dad recommended, and had the most special experience. It was a
              miniscule place, and I felt like we were cramming it full just
              with our small group. The worker at the bookstore asked us to do a
              reading of a few lines of Ulysses, after somehow spawning enough
              copies for everyone immediately. Anastasia and I read a passage
              (which was terrifying in the way that it reminded me of reading
              aloud in middle school), before a sprightly elderly man walked in
              with over 10 Icelandic people and proclaimed that he was "Going to
              sing his new friends a song!". He sang a Gaelic song that he told
              us he sang to Lana del Rey a few months prior (which led her to
              tears), and his cover of
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molly_Malone"
                >'Molly Malone'</a
              >'. He taught us the words to 'Molly Malone' and we all joined in
              on the chorus, which was a very special and incredibly random
              experience. That whole event stayed in my head all day because of
              how wild of an occurrence it was. I loved every minute of it, and
              the entirety of today really felt like Dublin at its finest.
              Everything was buzzing with vibrance and vitality.
            </p>
            <p>
              After Sweny's we continued to explore Grafton street and ended up
              at the <a href="https://muji.ie/">Muji</a> store, where we got
              some new pens. From there we explored Grafton street, and ended up
              getting pizza at <a href="https://www.manipizza.ie/">Mani</a> and
              getting ice cream at
              <a href="https://murphysicecream.ie/">Murphy's</a>, which was
              absolutely amazing. I got the Irish Garden and Honeycomb Caramel
              flavors, and both were fantastic. We paid a necessary visit to the
              <a href="https://www.visitdublin.com/molly-malone"
                >Molly Malone</a
              >
              statue and the
              <a
                href="https://panoramicireland.com/blog-ireland-guide/dublin-umbrellas-zozimus-street-colour"
                >Umbrella Alley</a
              >, and window shopped around Grafton Street some more. Then, Mari,
              Sophie, Sarah and I sat at
              <a href="https://cissmaddens.ie/">Ciss Maddens</a>, a pub on
              <a
                href="https://lovindublin.com/explore-dublin/lovin-dublin-city-spotlight-drury-street"
                >Drury Street</a
              >, to people watch and enjoy the lively environment of Dublin on a
              Friday night. It felt like there was something in the air today
              (and everyone in our program agrees), I've been in the best mood
              I've been in this whole trip and feel so energized, and it seems
              like everyone I've passed today was feeling the same way too.
              Sophie and I sipped on some cocktails while writing postcards to
              our loved ones with our new pens, and it was a very bright way to
              start a Friday night. Once I got back to our room, Anastasia and
              decided to have a lower energy Friday night that still allowed us
              to experience Dublin's pubs, and go to the bar down the street for
              one pint. I remember during our orientation that someone described
              pubs as Dublin's third place, and the one we went to,
              <a href="https://www.thelibertybelle.ie/">The Liberty Belle</a>,
              really made that statement feel true. There was a range of people
              in there, from elderly regulars, to someone celebrating their
              confirmation, to mates watching a rugby match, to some people our
              age enjoying a nice Friday out on the town. It was sweet to
              experience a smaller, more local pub that had a lot of history and
              loyalty associated with it. They also have a five Euro toastie and
              tea deal, which we will most definitely be back for!

              This morning at 9am, we embarked on our weekend trip to Galway.
              First, we arrived in Galway City to check into the
              <a
                href="https://www.kinlaygalway.ie/welcome-kinlay-hostel-galway/"
                >Kinlay Hostel</a
              >. Then we headed out to eat lunch in town and explore a bit, and
              we ended up grabbing food at the Craft Market in
              <a href="https://www.galwaytourism.ie/eyre-square/">Eyre Square</a
              >. I got a mysore dosa, which is an Indian lentil crepe, as well
              as a dirty chai and a cookie from the cafe next door to the
              square. Then we walked around the city a bit and visited some gift
              shops. I loved the banners of the tricolors of Ireland that were
              strung throughout the streets, as well as the abundance of people
              playing music on the street.
            </p>
            <p>
              Next we headed out to the
              <a href="https://ccmireland.com/"
                >Computer and Communications Museum of Ireland</a
              >, which was a living archive of different forms of commmunicative
              technology such as old computers, phones, radios, and video game
              consoles. I really enjoyed hearing about the evolution of Apple
              from one of the guides at the museum, who actually worked at Apple
              when he was younger. We spent some time hearing about the
              evolution of radio communication from the other guide at the
              museum, then had some free time to explore the old game consoles
              and computers. I found an old tennis arcade game that I particular
              enjoyed playing, as it had a two player mode so you could play
              against other people.
            </p>
            <p>
              From the museum we went back to Galway to explore some more, so
              Sarah, Lauren, Mari and I went to see the
              <a href="https://www.galwaytourism.ie/the-spanish-arch/"
                >Spanish Arch</a
              >
              and walk by the water until dinner time. Then we met up with
              everyone at <a href="http://www.mcdonaghs.net/">McDonagh's</a> for
              traditional fish and chips, and got some recommendations for where
              to go after. Sarah and Lauren and I went to
              <a href="https://quaysgalway.ie/">The Quays Bar</a>, where we
              tried, (and failed), to "split the G". We heard some live music
              for a bit there, and then went to the other side of the river,
              which is known as the West End. We walked around the park and
              coastal trail for a while, and went down the pier. The sun was
              setting as we were walking so it was a beautiful view of the sea.
              We got to see the houses on
              <a href="https://www.theirishroadtrip.com/the-long-walk-galway/"
                >The Long Walk</a
              >, which are a recognizable row of colorful houses in Galway. From
              there we went to
              <a href="http://www.thecranebar.com/">The Crane Bar</a>, but it
              was a bit too packed to stay, so we went to
              <a href="https://massimogalway.com/">Massimo</a>, which was a bar
              down the street from it. Massimo ended up being perfect for our
              night, as we were able to start off with hard kombuchas and talk
              for a while, before moving to the dance floor once the DJ began
              playing. We tried Baby Guinness shots for the first time, which
              are shots of Kahlua and Baileys that look like a miniature pint of
              Guinness. We danced for a few hours, and had a great time
              people-watching all the folks gathered there. Massimo had a garden
              in the back that led to an entirely different outdoor area called
              the Soul Garden, which we went and perused every time we needed a
              break. From Massimo we went to
              <a href="https://www.frontdoorpub.com/">The Front Door</a> on our
              way home, which felt like it was never-ending. There were so many
              different rooms and floors, and it felt like the bar just kept on
              going. We stayed for one song and then ended up leaving, but they
              played "Murder on the Dancefloor" which made it worth it. Sophie
              and I had been trying to get the DJ at Massimo to play it, but he
              didn't end up doing it, so it felt like fate that that was the
              first song playing at The Front Door when we walked in. We called
              it a night after The Front Door and headed home to get some sleep
              before the Cliffs of Moher trip.

          <h3>Walking the Cliffs of Moher</h3>
          <button class="accordion">
            <b><time datetime="2024-05-16">May 19, 2024 ~ Sunday</time></b>
          </button>
          <div class="panel">
            <p>
              This morning, after eating a quick breakfast at the hostel, we
              checked out and headed to the
              <a href="https://www.cliffsofmoher.ie/">Cliffs of Moher</a>. We
              stopped at
              <a href="https://www.dunguairecastle.com/">Dunguaire Castle</a> on
              the way for a quick 15 minute exploration, and then continued on.
              Once we got the cliffs, we ate at the cafe. Lauren and I got ham &
              cheese toasties, which came with a side of 2 salads. Those salads
              felt like the first real vegetables I've had this trip, and they
              were so good (and necessary). Then, we embarked on our walk of the
              cliffs, which was incredibly scenic. It was beautiful weather
              outside today so the cliffs were busy with people exploring. There
              were a lot of cows grazing by the cliffs, and at one point once we
              got far enough down the trail, there wasn't even a barrier between
              the humans and the cows. The cliffs looked exactly like the
              movies, and the pictures don't do them justice. They were
              majestic, especially with all the wildflowers, birds, and water
              surrounding them.
            </p>
            <p>
              After the cliffs, we took a rest stop at the
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama_Plaza"
                >Barack Obama Service Plaza</a
              >, which is a gas station dedicated to Barack Obama. I'd heard of
              this on TikTok but forgot it was in Ireland, so I was very happy
              we got to see it. It was kind of silly and random but I appreciate
              how connected Ireland is to America. There was a statue of Barack
              and Michelle out front, as well as various pictures throughout the
              station itself.
            </p>
            <p>
              Once we got home, I wanted to maximize the sunny day by exploring
              Dublin a bit more. I went to get gifts for my family and friends
              and also picked up the green Guinness sweater I've been eyeing all
              week, which I am so excited about. It's my favorite color, and
              Guinness is really starting to grow on me, so it'll be a great
              reminder of my time here. Then I grabbed some pad thai for dinner
              from <a href="https://www.wokinnoodle.com/">Wok In Noodle Bar</a>.
              in the Grafton Street area, and ate it in
              <a href="https://www.ststephensgreenpark.ie/"
                >St. Stephen's Green</a
              >. There were so many people having picnics and enjoying the nice
              weather. I got to watch the beginning of the sunset, and then
              headed to
              <a
                href="https://www.buildingsofireland.ie/buildings-search/building/50080682/saint-patricks-park-patrick-street-bull-alley-street-dublin-8-dublin"
                >St. Patrick's park</a
              >
              to meet up with Sophie and Sarah. We sat and enjoyed another
              beautiful park, (this one filled with dogs frolicking), before
              getting booted by the security guard because they were closing. It
              was a great way to wrap up a sunny, nature-filled day!

          <h3>Trinity Tour, Museums, and Gardens</h3>
          <button class="accordion">
            <b><time datetime="2024-05-16">May 20, 2024 ~ Monday</time></b>
          </button>
          <div class="panel">
            <p>
              This morning we didn't have class, so Anastasia and I decided to
              have a leisurely morning and try out a new coffee shop. We went to
              <a href="https://www.twopupscoffee.com/">Two Pups</a>, and I got a Vietnamese iced coffee and Anastasia got a
              cinnamon roll. From there, we walked around downtown Dublin and
              visited the entryway to the <a href="https://www.nli.ie/">National Library of Ireland</a> before
              meeting Margot at Trinity for our walking tour. Margot bought us
              coffee at <a href="https://www.butlerschocolates.com/en/chocolate-cafes">Butler's Chocolate Cafe</a>, and then we set off on our
              tour. It was very cool to hear about Trinity from a former
              student's perspective. We finished up by talking about potential
              for future studies in Ireland, which got me thinking about the
              idea of going to grad school outside of the United States. After
              the tour, Sophie, Sarah and I laid on the grass in the cricket
              pitch at Trinity College and enjoyed the sun for a bit. Then we
              went to the <a href="https://www.tcd.ie/library/old-library/">Old Library and the Book of Kells</a> at Trinity College,
              which were both beautiful. One of my favorite movies growing up
              was <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0485601/">The Secret of Kells</a>, so I was so excited to see all of it come
              to life and to see the history in person. Even though all the
              books in the Old Library were being cleaned, it was still so
              beautiful. There is so much visible history, and it was definitely
              one of the highlights of the trip.
            </p>
            <p>
              After the Old Library, we went to the Dead Zoo at the <a href="https://www.museum.ie/">National
              Museum of Ireland</a>, and then decided to spend some time at the
              <a href="https://www.nationalgallery.ie/">National Gallery of Ireland</a>, which was my favorite museum that I've been to
              yet. I could spend all day looking at the amazing art there, and I
              did spent over 2 hours walking around. The architecture within the
              gallery itself also helped to highlight the work itself, as it all
              had beautiful natural lighting and bright colors. Once I finished
              up at the National Gallery, I decided to take advantage of the
              sunshine and walk around some of the parks I've been wanting to
              visit in Dublin. I went to <a href="https://www.dublincity.ie/residential/parks/dublin-city-parks/visit-park/merrion-square-park">Merrion Square Park</a> and saw the famous Oscar
              Wilde statue. In Merrion Square this week, the <a href="https://ilfdublin.com/">International
              Literature Festival</a> is going on so it was fun to experience a bit
              of that and see everyone gathered together. I got some pork and
              chive dumplings from a food truck in the park and they were one of
              the best things I've eaten this trip. Then I went on to the <a href="https://iveaghgardens.ie/">Iveagh
              Gardens</a>, and saw a beautiful waterfall. This park was filled with
              lots of intricate paths and greenery, and they even had a hedge
              maze and a rose garden that was in bloom. The rose garden had such
              an amazing fragrance, so I spent a bit of time just hanging out
              there and enjoying the flowers.
            </p>
            <p>
              Then I went back home to take a quick Zoom meeting, and then
              headed out to dinner. Anastasia, Lauren, Mari, Sophie, Sarah and I
              went to <a href="https://www.masadublin.com/">Masa</a> for tacos, which we've been wanting to try since we
              got here. Thankfully, the wait wasn't too long and we were
              actually able to get a table. It was definitely worth coming back
              for, the tacos were incredible. Mari and I split some al pastor
              tacos and I got some chorizo tacos for myself. From Masa we
              decided to go to <a href="https://www.noname.bar/">Bar With No Name</a> for a drink, and we played some
              riddle games while we were there. Then, we wrapped up the night at
              <a href="https://www.jtpims.ie/">J.T. Pims</a>, where we talked about our last week and what our plans
              are after this program.

              This morning during class, we did accessibility reviews of the CEA CAPA Dublin site, and then worked on finishing our webpages and updating the content from our weekend trip. After class, Lauren and I went to the Fumbally for lunch. We've been there quite a few times this trip, but it's just so perfectly on the way from class to home and it's consistently amazing. I love that they have healthy vegetarian options that are flavorful. Not to mention their coffee and pastries are amazing.

              Then, we went home for a bit before our next activity, and I FaceTimed one of my friends from home for a little bit. It was nice to catch up about what we've been up to so far this summer. After that, Lauren, Mari, Anastasia and I went to the whiskey museum to do a guided tour and tasting session. It was interesting to learn about the chemical process of distillation, and how whiskey became both legal and popular over the years in Ireland. I've never been able to taste different notes in things like coffee, liquor, or wine, but I felt like the ones they provided during the tasting were distinct enough that I was able to. One of them really smelled sweet, like vanilla or caramel. In one of the rooms they pretended to raid the illegal bar and arrest us for illegal consumption / production, which was a funny way of immersing us in the experience.

              Once we finished up at the whiskey museum, we headed back to Griffith College for our Irish dance class. I was very surprised to see that there was live music as well as a dance instructor, as there was a fiddle player, an accordion player, and a flute player all playing traditional Irish music. It was fun to try to learn some traditional jigs with friends, and I felt that it was really similar to American square dancing. It was a very active and engaging experience, and it really reinforced my love for traditional Irish music.

              After the class, I went to the portal next to the spire and James Joyce statue in North Dublin. The portal is a live video feed that connects an area of downtown Dublin to downtown New York. I have some cousins that live in New York, so we scheduled a time that we would both go to the portal to be able to see each other. It was so silly, and was like a worse version of FaceTime, but it was so funny to be able to connect with each other through continents and time zones by a randomly placed portal. I went home after the portal, and then a few of us went to The George to dance. Lauren participated in a lip-sync for your life challenge and absolutely crushed it, and was second place to winning 3,000 Euros. After The George, we went to the bar we went to on the first day to hear more traditional Irish music, the Oliver St. John Gogarty. The bar was really busy because there is a big soccer final in Dublin this week, in the Europa league. There was a bunch of drunk Liverpool fans in the bar who were working on accepting that their team didn't make it to the finals, so we weren't able to hear the music that well over their chanting. It was a fun night though, we were able to meet a nice girl from Ohio who studied abroad in Belfast during college and was visiting again, and some guys from Amsterdam who came to watch the final. They had plenty to say about America, so it was interesting to hear their thoughts. They described it as a country where "Everyone be surfing, shooting, or eating barbecue", which isn't even that far off of a description.
