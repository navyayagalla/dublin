          <h3>A Trip to the Countryside & Howth Cliffs</h3>
          <b><time datetime="2024-05-07">May 6, 2024 ~ Monday</time></b>
          <p>
            Hooray for the first day of the trip! We went to
            <a href="https://www.visitdublin.com/howth-cliff-path-loop"
              >Howth Cliffs</a
            >
            straight from the Dublin airport to fight our looming jet lag. The
            cliffs were absolutely beautiful, right on the sea and surrounded by
            blooming yellow flowers. The steep stone steps led down to an
            incredible view.
          </p>
          <p>
            After exploring Howth and eating some lovely seafood at
            <a href="https://wrightsofhowth.shop/pages/crabbyjos">Crabby Jo's</a
            >, we went back to Dublin and checked into our lodging for the trip.
            From there we enjoyed a dinner at the oldest pub in Ireland,
            <a href="https://brazenhead.com/">the Brazen Head</a>!

          <h3>Exploring Dublin: A City of History and Culture</h3>
          <b><time datetime="2024-05-07">May 7, 2024 ~ Tuesday</time></b>
          <p>
            On this Tuesday, we had our first day of orientation for the CEA
            Capa program and went on a historic bus tour of Dublin! Our tour
            guide showed us many of the famous battle locations while telling us
            about the bigger parts of Irish history. We learned more about
            <a href="https://www.ighm.org/learn.html"
              >the Great Hunger of Ireland</a
            >
            and how that led to Irish emigration across the world.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some of the locations we went to on this tour included
            <a
              href="https://heritageireland.ie/places-to-visit/phoenix-park-peoples-flower-gardens/"
              >the People's Gardens</a

              >Church of the Sacred Heart</a
            >
            which included a dedication to the buried rebels,
            <a href="https://www.visitdublin.com/the-jeanie-johnston"
              >the Jeanie Johnston Famine Ship</a
            >

          <h3>First Day of Class!</h3>
          <b><time datetime="2024-05-07">May 8, 2024 ~ Wednesday</time></b>
          <p>
            SI 339 began today! We had our first class and created our website
            detailing our study abroad trip to Dublin, which you're on right now
            (inception...). After playing around with styling, adding some
            pictures, finding Irish fonts, and creating a blog, we wrapped up
            class for the day.
          </p>
          <p>
            From there, we had the rest of the day to explore Dublin so we went
            to a charity shop and then explored
            <a href="https://www.graftonstreet.ie/">Grafton Street</a>! We
            grabbed some coffee and enjoyed spending time in nature at
            <a href="https://www.ststephensgreenpark.ie/">St. Stephen's Green</a
            >. Finally, we went to
            <a href="https://johnsbar.ie/">John's Bar & Haberdashery</a> to take
            advantage of their student burger meal deal.

            Guest Lecture with Dr David Williams: Games, Engagement, and
            Accessibility
          </h3>
          <b><time datetime="2024-05-09">May 9, 2024 ~ Thursday</time></b>
          <p>
            In class today, we learned about flexbox, transitions, media
            queries, and responsive design. To apply these concepts, we played
            around with our image grids and adapted our webpages to be
            accessible and viewable on both mobile and desktop views. After
            class, we had a lunch break. After eating lunch back at my room, I
            came back to
            <a href="https://www.griffith.ie/">Griffith College</a> campus and
            decided to try a coffee and a pastry from
            <a href="https://noshington.ie/">Noshington Cafe</a>, the cafe down
            the street from our college. It was amazing and I will definitely be
            going back!
          </p>
          <p>
            After we came back to campus, it was time for our guest lecture from
            Dr. David Williams and his wife, Anna Leary. I found this lecture to
            be very interesting and engaging, as it covered the topics of
            accessibility and gameification within the realm of web design. Dr.
            Williams talked about the theory behind gameification and Anna Leary
            showed us some practical examples of web design by detailing how she
            had to overhaul the
            <a href="https://library.dbs.ie/"
              >Dublin Business School's Library website</a
            >. Once class was over, we decided to grab dinner together in the
            Grafton Street neighborhood. We wanted to go to a really popular and
            well-reviewed taco restaurant called
            <a href="https://www.masadublin.com/">Masa</a>, but it was fully
            booked so we agreed to make reservations and come another time. From
            there, we went to
            <a href="https://theramenbar.ie/">The Ramen Bar</a>, which had great
            food and even better ambiance.

          <h3>Visit to the EPIC Emigration Museum</h3>
          <b><time datetime="2024-05-09">May 10, 2024 ~ Friday</time></b>
          <p>
            First Friday in Dublin! In class today we talked about responsive
            web design and accessibility in navigation. We updated our navbars
            to display the current page more distinctly and made sure all of our
            links were active and working. After class, I went to
            <a href="https://www.libertymarket.ie/">the Liberty Market</a> and
            browsed the variety of merchandise they had at the market. It was
            only a few blocks away from our lodging! I bought a Turkish bracelet
            before going home to eat lunch.
          </p>
          <p>
            After lunch, I walked to
            <a href="https://epicchq.com/">the EPIC Emigration Museum</a> for
            our class visit. Almost the whole walk was along the water, so it
            was a beautiful view to take in! It was beautifully sunny today so I
            wanted to take advantage of the nice weather. The emigration museum
            was incredibly detailed and informative, and I felt like I learned
            alot about the places that Irish people went to after the famine,
            and the lives they formed once they got there. Lauren and I struck
            up a great conversation with one of the museum docents about local's
            recommendations for Dublin, Maymesters, and what life at
            <a href="https://www.ucd.ie/">University College Dublin</a> is like
            for her.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once we ended our museum visit, Lauren and I walked around the north
            side of the river, as we hadn't explored that area a lot. We ended
            up trying, (and LOVING) Irish Coffee at
            <a href="https://www.vicecoffeeinc.com/">Vice Coffee</a>, and we
            both also indulged in baked goods to satisfy our sugar cravings.
            Then we went to
            <a href="https://www.winding-stair.com/">The Winding Stair</a>, an
            adorable bookstore along the river where I got some postcards to
            send to my family. There were ebautiful watercolor renditions of
            Dublin sites, and I got one of
            <a
              href="https://www.buildingsofireland.ie/buildings-search/building/50080682/saint-patricks-park-patrick-street-bull-alley-street-dublin-8-dublin"
              >St. Patrick's Park</a
            >, since it is the park that is so close to our lodging. I'm excited
            to celebrate my first Friday night in Dublin and reflect on the
            first wonderful week!

          <h3>Trip to Glendalough & Kilkenny</h3>
          <b><time datetime="2024-05-09">May 11, 2024 ~ Saturday</time></b>
          <p>
            Today our whole group went on a day trip to
            <a href="https://glendalough.ie/">Glendalough</a> &
            <a href="https://visitkilkenny.ie/">Kilkenny</a>, two beautiful
            areas of Ireland! At Glendalough, we explored the monastic ruins
            that exist there and learned about the history of
            <a href="https://glendalough.ie/heritage/monastic-city/"
              >St. Kevin's community</a
            >. Then, we ventured down the trail surrounding the
            <a href="https://www.nationalparks.ie/wicklow/"
              >Wicklow Mountains</a
            >
            to the lower & upper lakes, the former of which can be seen below.
            They were absolutely breath-taking, and had such picturesque views I
            almost couldn't believe they were real. It was beautiful and sunny
            and there were even people swimming in the lakes! By the upper lake
            there was a tree that had a limb that was bent perfectly in the
            shape of a hammock, and there was someone relaxing and reading a
            book in it. Overall, Glendalough lived up to its Irish name of being
            the "Glen Between Lakes", and was an incredibly green and serene
            area.
          </p>
          <p>
            From there, we went to Kilkenny to explore
            <a href="https://kilkennycastle.ie/">Kilkenny Castle</a> and the
            surrounding town. The castle itself was grand from the outside, but
            the restoration of the inside was the most amazing part. There were
            20 different rooms and areas to explore within the castle, each
            restored to how it would've been when the castle was operational. My
            favorite room was the
            <a href="https://kilkennycastle.ie/the-picture-gallery/"
              >Picture Gallery Wing</a
            >, a room filled with beautiful paintings that had dark, immersive
            lighting similar to what I've seen of Trinity College's Long Room.
            The green surrounding the castle was filled with people enjoying the
            sun and picnic-ing. A shopkeeper in Kilkenny told us that it was a
            lot busier that day because Bruce Springsteen was having a concert
            in town that night!
          </p>
          <p>
            After the day trip, Lauren and I took the bus for the first time and
            got dinner at <a href="https://www.kari.ie/">Kari</a>, one of the
            most highly rated restaurants in Dublin. The food was absolutely
            incredible! It is an Indian restaurant, so I got the lamb biryani,
            and Lauren got chicken makhani. We both cleaned our plates in a
            matter of minutes, and the chef was so impressed with our speed and
            enjoyment that he brought us free dessert! The biryani was dotted
            with pomegranate seeds and spiced to perfection. I will definitely
            remember this meal as one of my favorites in Dublin, it was some of
            the best food I've had in a really long time!

          <h3>A Tour of Belfast & Northern Ireland</h3>
          <b><time datetime="2024-05-09">May 12, 2024 ~ Sunday</time></b>
          <p>
            On our free day, Sophie, Sarah, Lauren, Anastasia, and I decided to
            book a bus tour to
            <a href="https://www.irishtourism.com/belfast"
              >Belfast & Northern Ireland</a
            >
            to explore the northern part of the island! The tour left at 6am,
            and first took us to Belfast for a
            <a href="https://belfasttours.com/">black cab tour</a> of Belfast's
            political history (the dynamic of which is still a huge part of the
            city today). I'd never known about the extent of separation between
            the Unionist and Nationalist areas of Ireland, and it was incredibly
            interesting to learn about how their beliefs connect to other areas
            in world politics as well. Since we were in Northern Ireland, we
            were officially in the United Kingdom, which was something I hadn't
            quite wrapped my head around yet.
          </p>
          <p>
            From the black cab tour, we went to
            <a
              href="https://discovernorthernireland.com/things-to-do/dunluce-castle-p675011"
              >Dunluce Castle</a
            >, and then went to the
            <a
              href="https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/visit/northern-ireland/giants-causeway"
              >Giant's Causeway</a
            >, where we wrapped up the tour. Dunluce Castle was absolutely
            beautiful, as it lays right on the cliffs of Northern Ireland. The
            view was breathtaking, and the weather held out so we got to
            experience the castle to the fullest extent. Anastasia and I were
            able to go up inside of the round tower, which made the view even
            better. The Giant's Causeway was something I was incredibly excited
            to see, as my dad used to read me folk tales about it as a kid.
            Hearing the bus tour guide recap
            <a
              href="https://www.thegiantscausewaytour.com/the-giants-causeway-story/"
              >the folklore</a
            >
            behind it's creation reminded me of my childhood, and it definitely
            exceeded expectations. The causeway itself is incredibly beautiful,
            and the color of the stones contrasted with the sea in a stunning
            manner. The hike down to the Causeway took us down the Shepherd's
            Steps, which were a steep set of stairs followed by a short trail
            down to the Causeway, complete with incredible scenery along the
            way. After our nature exploration, we decided to follow our tour
            guide's recommendation and get lunch at
            <a
              href="https://discovernorthernireland.com/food-and-drink/the-nook-at-the-giants-causeway-p685931"
              >The Nook</a
            >, 1 of 2 small restaurants at the Causeway. Our tour guide said
            that the Irish Stew at the Nook would be his death row meal should
            capital punishment ever return to Ireland, and so naturally, we all
            had to try it. It did not disappoint, and after our long day, it
            felt like one of the most satisfying meals I'd had in a long time.

          <h3>Visit to the National Disability Authority of Ireland</h3>
          <b><time datetime="2024-05-09">May 13, 2024 ~ Monday</time></b>
          <p>
            Today we finally got to experience some true Irish weather! It was
            rainy and a bit bleary for most of the day, but it got sunnier
            towards the end of the night. In class we reflected on our weekend
            by developing our Glendalough and Kilkenny pages, and reviewed the
            content that we've covered in the course thusfar. After class, I ate
            lunch at <a href="https://little-bird.ie/">Little Bird Cafe</a> and
            worked on my website for a while. Then, I headed back to Griffith
            College to meet up with the students to head to the
            <a href="https://nda.ie/"
              >National Disability Authority of Ireland</a
            >.
          </p>
          <p>
            There, Donal Rice gave a talk on how the Civil Rights movement was
            the precursor to the Accessibility movement, and in turn, the Web
            Accessibility movement. It was amazing to see how the history of
            advocacy and disability awareness connect, and to see how dynamic of
            a field it still is today. We compared European Union and United
            States approaches to disability policy, and discussed whose approach
            might be better. After the talk, Lauren and I explored
            <a href="https://jamartfactory.com/">Jam Art Factory</a> near our
            lodging and I purchased a beautiful print of Dublin to put in my
            room in Ann Arbor. Afterwards, Anastasia and I went grocery shopping
            again and made dinner in our room. We made some delicious pasta and
            then headed out to meet Sophie, Sarah, and Lauren for a pint at
            <a href="http://www.lordedward.ie/">the Lord Edward</a>, which was
            supposed to have the best Guinness in town, according to our first
            tour guide. We tried it, and out of the three Guinnesses I've had, I
            can safely say it is the best one yet!
