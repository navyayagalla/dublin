        <h3>A Trip to the Countryside & Howth Cliffs</h3>
        <time datetime="2024-05-07">May 6, 2024 ~ Monday</time>
        <p>
          Hooray for the first day of the trip! We went to Howth Cliffs straight
          from the Dublin airport to fight our looming jet lag. The cliffs were
          absolutely beautiful, right on the sea and surrounded by blooming
          yellow flowers. The steep stone steps led down to an incredible view.
          After exploring Howth and eating some lovely seafood at Crabby Jo's,
          we went back to Dublin and checked into our lodging for the trip. From
          there we enjoyed a dinner at the oldest pub in Ireland, the Brazen
          Head!

        <h3>Exploring Dublin: A City of History and Culture</h3>
        <time datetime="2024-05-07">May 7, 2024 ~ Tuesday</time>
        <p>
          On this Tuesday, we had our first day of orientation for the CEA Capa
          program and went on a historic bus tour of Dublin! Our tour guide
          showed us many of the famous battle locations while telling us about
          the bigger parts of Irish history. We learned more about the Great
          Famine of Ireland and how that led to Irish emigration across the
          world. Some of the locations we went to on this tour included the
          People's Gardens, The Sacred Heart Church which included a dedication
          to the buried rebels, the Jeanie Johnston Famine Ship & surrounding
          statues, and the Christchurch Cathedral.
