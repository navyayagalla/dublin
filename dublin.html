                    <p class="statuetext">This statue of Oscar Wilde lounging on a rock is located in Merrion Square Park, which is on the street where Oscar Wilde grew up. Oscar Wilde was an Irish poet and playwright, known best for his works "The Importance of Being Earnest" and "The Picture of Dorian Gray". The statue itself is life-sized, as Oscar Wilde was 6'3".His childhood home is located at 1 Merrion Square, and is now a tourist attraction. This sculpture was placed in the park in 1997 and was created by sculptor Danny Osborne. The statue is formed from granite, jade, and thulite, and was commissioned by the Guinness Ireland Group to commemorate the famous Irish author. In the statue, Oscar Wilde is wearing a Trinity College tie, which is a reference to his Alma Mater located close by.</p>

                    <h2>Molly Malone Statue: Suffolk Street, Dublin</h2>
                    <p class="statuetext">Molly Malone was a fictional fishmonger who became a historical icon of Ireland. She is best known through the common Irish folk song "Molly Malone" (sometimes known as "Cockles and Mussels"), which details the life of the fishmonger before succumbing to the fever that eventually kills her. This song has been covered by many popular voices, such as The Dubliners and Joni Mitchell. The statue was placed on Grafton Street on June 13, 1988, which was then declared to be Molly Malone Day. It was then relocated to Suffolk Street in 2014, due to the tram track being placed in its original location. The statue is a lighter color in areas where it is frequently touched by tourists and visitors, which has led to locals criticizing the objectification of the statue. A campaign was started called Leave Molly mAlone to call attention to the misogyny associated with the tourist tradition of touching the statue.</p>

                    <h2>The Famine Memorial: City Docklands, Dublin.</h2>
                    <p class="statuetext">These statues of famine victims can be found on Custom House Quay, in the Dublin City Docklands. The statues are large in height to emphasize the emaciated nature of the figures. The figures vary, some being men, children, and women, and one even representing a starved dog. They face towards the Dublin Docks, and the recreation of the famine ship that once docked there called the Jeanie Johnston. This is meant to represent the desperate journey that people made to the famine ship as a last resort before starvation. They would travel with their limited belongings to these so-called "coffin ships", as most of the people on board would die before reaching their destination. The famine memorial statues reference The Great Hunger of Ireland, the famine that led to the starvation and death of over 1 million people, and the emigration of another million. The famine was caused by the potato blight, which affected the staple crop of Irish agriculture. Ireland's entire population fell by 25% because of the famine. The statues were placed on Custom House Quay in 1997, and were designed by a sculptor from Dublin name Rowan Gillespie. </p>

      <h2 class="title">Dublin BeReals</h2>
      <p class="berealtext">BeReal is a social media app that provides its users with a 2 minute time range in which they can post a photo showing what they are currently doing at that time. It provides a real glimpse into people's lives, attempting to address the false nature of planned social media posts. It adds a sense of randomness to the idea of having a social media presence, so I decided to document my time in Dublin through BeReals. I took one every day, most of them on time, and they can be found below.</p>
      <h3 class="berealtext">You can click on the images to swap the smaller and bigger photos, in the same way that the images can be interacted with on the BeReal app.</h3>
