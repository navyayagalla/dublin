    <h2>About Glendalough</h2>
    <p>Glendalough is located in Wicklow County, Ireland, and it's name directly translates to glen of the 2 lakes. Like the name suggests, it is situated in a valley between 2 beautiful lakes, and contains the remains of the monastic city founded by <span aria-label="Saint">St.</span> Kevin's house, and what is left of the cathedral. The site is also a graveyard, and acts as a burial site for many families. A surrounding field where sheep graze brings peace to the site.</p>
    <p>A short walk down the path surrounding the Wicklow Mountains will bring you to the lower lake, which boasts spectacular views of the valley. Walk a little further and you will reach the upper lake, which is the site of the most picturesque views. A massive lake allows for swimming and enjoyment of nature, with a picnic green and other areas of relaxation around it. From here you can truly see how the lake is shaped by the mountains in the area. </p>
